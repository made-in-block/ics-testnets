## Status

* Timeline
  * 2022-12-02: Spawn time: `2022-12-05T12:00:00.000000000Z`
  * 2022-12-03: Proposal # voting period ends
  * 2022-11-28: Proposal # goes into voting period
  * 2022-11-28: Genesis file without CCV state is generated

The following items will be included in the proposal:
* Genesis file hash
  * The SHA256 is used to verify against the genesis file that the proposer has made available for review.
  * This "fresh" genesis file cannot be used to run the chain: it must be updated with the CCV states after the spawn time is reached.
* Binary hash
* Spawn time
  * Even if the proposal passes, the CCV states will not be available from the provider chain until after the spawn time is reached.

## Chain Data

### Binary

The binary published in this repo is the `oriond` binary built using the `made-in-block/mib-consumer-chain` repo tag [v0.1.0](https://github.com/made-in-block/mib-consumer-chain/releases/tag/v0.1.0). You can generate the binary following the [Get Started section](https://github.com/made-in-block/mib-consumer-chain/tree/v0.1.0#get-started). Docker images are available [here](https://github.com/orionlove-ventures/heighliner/pkgs/container/heighliner%2Forion). Check out our [Video](https://youtu.be/npoIZacWxRw?t=1079) on how to build this binary inside Docker to get a checksum match.

### Verify Binary Checksum.
Binary checksums can differ based on many things to include go, libc, and make versions. To get a consistent checksum you can use something like docker to verify.

  * [Linux amd64 build](oriond)
  * Version: `v0.1.0`
  * SHA256: `fff8f248c73929a621bb6ce5553bc07a2385095091e5fdff2e38c71be8b166c0`

  ```
  docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/bash ghcr.io/strangelove-ventures/checksum:v.0.1.0
  ```
  ```
  # run inside docker container.
  git clone https://github.com/made-in-block/mib-consumer-chain.git orion
  cd orion
  git fetch
  git checkout v0.1.0
  make install
  sha256sum ~/go/bin/oriond
  ```
  expected return `fff8f248c73929a621bb6ce5553bc07a2385095091e5fdff2e38c71be8b166c0`

### Genesis file

**The genesis file for Interchain Security consumer chains must include the CCV (Cross Chain Validation) state generated by the provider chain _after_ the spawn time is reached.**

Final genesis file **with CCV state**: **`pending spawn time`**
- SHA256: `pending spawn time`
- Validators must replace their `config/genesis.json` file with this one before running the binary.

The genesis file with was generated using the following settings:

* Chain ID: `mib-orion`
* Denom: `uorion`
* Signed blocks window: `"8640"`
* Genesis file **without CCV state**: [`orion-fresh-genesis.json`](orion-fresh-genesis.json), SHA256: `ce71a710768ca94eab8bb675aa194e6ee5026a86bec41a36a5bca158f04640c2`
  * **This is provided only for verification, this is not the genesis file validators should be running their nodes with.**

## Endpoints

* **p2p persistent peers : ``**
* These peers represent the `Made in Block`validator. We are accepting `250` inbound peeers, but please consider sharing your peers in discord, or create a PR to [`peers.txt`](peers.txt)

* Please keep in mind that any validator that does not come online after 67% of the voting power is up and running, is likely to be slashed for downtime, potentially resulting in being jailed (the `signed_blocks_window` parameter is set to `8640`).

## Join via Bash Script

On the node machine:
- Copy the `node_key.json` and `priv_validator_key.json` files for your validator.
  - **These should be the same ones as the ones from your provider node**.
- Run one of the following scripts:
  - orion service: [orion-init.sh](orion-init.sh)
  - Cosmovisor service: [orion-init-cv.sh](orion-init-cv.sh)
- Wait until the spawn time is reached and the genesis file with the CCV states is available.
- Overwrite the genesis file with the one that includes the CCV states.
  - The default location is `$HOME/.orion/config/genesis.json`.
- Enable and start the service:
  - orion
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable orion
    sudo systemctl start orion
    ```
  - Cosmovisor
    ```
    sudo systemctl enable cv-orion
    sudo systemctl start cv-orion
    ```
- To follow the log, use:
  - orion: `journalctl -fu orion`
  - Cosmovisor: `journalctl -fu cv-orion`
- If the log does not show up right away, run `systemctl restart systemd-journald`.
